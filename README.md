# Fable-III-Patcher
An easier much more simple Patcher and troubleshooter included.

This is a Patching tool for the Public, as many people don't understand or like complications when it comes to getting this game to work the way it was supposed too.
This tool helps you with exactly that.

It has a built in troubleshooter for those frequently asked questions!

I hope this helps you guys out, I know it's helped me!

This Patcher includes all the required resources so there is no need to download them seperately.

Note:

You'll need the recources zip file found in releases if you plan on using this source code.

This is supported with both 32bit and 64bit operating systems.

Troubleshooting:

1. Make sure you have the folder "resources" included in the same folder as Fabel III Patcher.exe. This folder must contain the following: gfwlclient.msi, gfwlivesetup.exe, wllogin_32.msi, wllogin_64.msi, xliveredist.msi.
2. You should have the MetroSet UI.dll included as well inside the same folder as Fable III Patcher.exe.

File Structure should look like this:
[MAIN FOLDER]
/resources/
Fable III Patcher.exe
Metro UI.dll

[/resources FOLDER]
gfwlclient.msi
gfwlivesetup.exe
wllogin_32.msi
wllogin_64.msi
xliveredist.msi
