# Fable-III-Patcher
An easier much more simple Patcher and troubleshooter included.

This is a Patching tool for the Public, as many people don't understand or like complications when it comes to getting this game to work the way it was supposed too.
This tool helps you with exactly that.

It has a built in troubleshooter for those frequently asked questions!

I hope this helps you guys out, I know it's helped me!

This Patcher includes all the required resources so there is no need to download them seperately.


Visit the Releases section to download this patcher, I have conveniently zipped up everything you need. The Patcher will do the rest!
This should prevent those DOTS in the filenames, this was done by github during the upload for some strange reason; the zip file should have solved this.


Version 1.0.0.1

Added resources self installer, the application will now verify all the dependencies; if they are not found it will then automatically load them for you.
The resources zip file is no longer required.

If you notice any error popups please copy the error log and create a new Issue above.
