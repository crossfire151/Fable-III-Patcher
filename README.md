# Fable-III-Patcher
An easier much more simple Patcher and troubleshooter included.

This is a Patching tool for the Public, as many people don't understand or like complications when it comes to getting this game to work the way it was supposed too.
This tool helps you with exactly that.

It has a built in troubleshooter for those frequently asked questions!

I hope this helps you guys out, I know it's helped me!

This Patcher includes all the required resources so there is no need to download them seperately.


Visit the Releases section to download this patcher, I have conveniently zipped up everything you need. The Patcher will do the rest!
This should prevent those DOTS in the filenames, this was done by github during the upload for some strange reason; the zip file should have solved this.


# Looking for Voluntary Translators!

Currently this Patcher only Supports English.
As this Patcher grows in the upcoming future this application will need to be translated to support the NEW upcoming DLC Installtion feature.

# DECLARATION -> READ ME!

This software will gain in size as it updates,
The software instelf contains all the relevent dependencies to help Fable 3 run as expected by everyone.
This software also will contain all the required files for the DLC's, this will noticibily increase the file size of the Fable III Patcher.exe,
You will notice the size of the file exceed 1GB; this saves everyone having to hunt for the correct working DLC version,
where I say "working" and "correct", I mean this in literal sence as some guides seem a little confusing to follow as they are not very well
detailed, I myself admit that I found this a little difficult to get working; this involved a lot of googling to find the best guide.
The DLC Installer will do all the painful work for you.

# BACKUP, BACKUP, BACKUP!!

Before installing the DLC make sure you create a backup of your saves, we don't want any corruptions!


# Version 1.0.0.1

Added resources self installer, the application will now verify all the dependencies; if they are not found it will then automatically load them for you.
The resources zip file is no longer required.

If you notice any error popups please copy the error log and create a new Issue above.

REQUIREMENTS:
